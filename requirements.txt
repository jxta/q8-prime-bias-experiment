# Installation Notes:
# ==================
# 
# 1. Basic installation:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 2. For enhanced performance (requires system libraries):
#    - Install GMP library first: 
#      - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
#      - macOS: brew install gmp
#      - Windows: Use conda or pre-built wheels
#    - Then uncomment gmpy2 above and reinstall
#
# 3. For interactive plotting:
#    - Uncomment plotly and kaleido above
#    - pip install plotly kaleido
#
# 4. For development:
#    - Uncomment development tools above
#    - Consider using virtual environment: python -m venv venv
#
# 5. For Jupyter setup:
#    - After installation: jupyter notebook
#    - For JupyterLab: pip install jupyterlab
#
# 6. System requirements:
#    - Python 3.8 or higher
#    - 4+ GB RAM for basic experiments
#    - 16+ GB RAM for large-scale computations (10^8+ primes)
#    - Multi-core CPU recommended for parallel processing
#
# 7. Testing installation:
#    python tests/test_system.py --quick
